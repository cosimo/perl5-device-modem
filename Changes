Revision history for Perl extension Device::Modem.

1.27  Sun May 18 17:19:23 CET 2003
	- dial() now works as expected, returning the `CONNECT' or `BUSY'
          or whatever message without hanging for minutes;
	- answer() routine now is definitely more reliable than before:
          now everytime the buffer receives input from modem, it does
          not restart counting the timeout. Removed also the possibility
          of infinite loop if modem always receives garbage chars (like
          on a RAW PPP link);
        - Added full documentation for every method;
        - Added a FAQ document in new "docs/" folder;
	- new(): added possibility to pass a custom log object as `log'
          property;

1.23  Wed Dec  4 00:34:52 CET 2002
        - little documentation adjustments in main Modem.pm class;
        - removed use of `warnings.pm' 
        - now File log class opens the log file once and writes
          on already opened file handle, until final close().
        - Thanks to Joerg Neuberger for spotting out a problem with
          older perls (5.005_xx) and `use warnings'

	- improved command/response cycle with proper handling of timeout
          and idle/data cycles. Now it is more reliable also with fairly
	  big serial messages (removed this from TODO list).
	- removed warnings on undefined answer strings.

	- store_number() to store an address-book number (cannot retrieve yet);
	- restore_factory_settings() now accepts a number of profile (default=0);
	- dial() now dials also address book numbers (only if supplied number
	  is composed of 1 digit: the address book position, from 0 to 9).
        - status() method added, which looks up CTS, DSR, RLSD and RING signals;
