Copyright (C) 2002-2004 Cosimo Streppone, cosimo@cpan.org
=======================================================================

This is a perl extension to talk to AT compliant devices via serial port.
It should be enough platform independent as you need.

For more details, look at the "docs/" folder where you will find
a minimal FAQ ("docs/FAQ.pod"), and the full documentation for
this extension ("docs/Modem.pod").

Please contact me for any problems you may encounter using this beast.

Have fun!
