NAME
    Device::Modem - Perl extension to talk to modem devices connected via
    serial port

WARNING
       This is C<ALPHA> software, still needs extensive testing and
       support for generic AT commands, so use it at your own risk,
       and without C<ANY> warranty! Have fun.

SYNOPSIS
      use Device::Modem;

      my $modem = new Device::Modem( port => '/dev/ttyS1' )

      if( $modem->connect( baudrate => 9600 ) ) {
          print "connected!\n";
      } else {
          print "sorry, no connection with serial port!\n';
      }

      $modem->attention();          # send `attention' sequence (+++)

      $modem->dial('02270469012');  # dial phone number

      $modem->echo(1);              # enable local echo
      $modem->echo(0);              # disable it

      $modem->offhook();            # Take off hook (ready to dial)
      $modem->hangup();             # returns modem answer

      $modem->is_active();          # Tests whether modem device is active or not
                                    # So far it works for modem OFF/ modem ON condition

      $modem->reset();              # hangup + attention + restore setting 0 (Z0)

      $modem->restore_factory_settings();
                                    # Handle with care!

      $modem->send_init_string();   # Send initialization string
                                    # Now this is fixed to 'AT H0 Z S7=45 S0=0 Q0 V1 E0 &C0 X4'

      $modem->repeat();             # Repeat last command

      $modem->verbose(0);           # Modem responses are numerical
      $modem->verbose(1);           # Normal text responses

      #
      # Some raw AT commands
      #
      $modem->atsend( 'ATH0' );
      print $modem->answer();

      $modem->atsend( 'ATDT01234567' . Device::Modem::CR );
      print $modem->answer();

DESCRIPTION
    Device::Modem class implements basic AT (Hayes) compliant device
    abstraction. It is meant to be inherited by sub classes (as
    Device::Gsm), which are based on serial connections.

  REQUIRES

    Device::SerialPort (Win32::SerialPort for Windows machines)
  EXPORT

    None

TO-DO
    *   Document log interface

        Explain which type of logging hooks you can use with Device::Modem
        and its sub-classes (Device::Gsm). For now, they are only `file' and
        `syslog'

    *   AutoScan

        An AT command script with all interesting commands is run when
        `autoscan' is invoked, creating a `profile' of the current device,
        with list of supported commands, and database of
        brand/model-specific commands

    *   Test `parse_answer()' method

    *   Many more to come!
